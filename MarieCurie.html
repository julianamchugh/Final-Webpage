    	    <p>Marie was born in Warsaw, Poland on November 7, 1867. In 1891, Her father, 
    	    Wladyslaw Sklodowski, taught mathematics and physics, which were the to 
    	    subjects that eventually became her profession. She went to 
    	    Paris to study physics and mathematics at the Sorbonne where she met Pierre 
    	    Curie, the professor of the School of Physics whom she then married in 1895. 
    	    Her and her husband ended up working together to investigate 
    	    <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1911/">radioactivity</a></li>.</p> 
    	    <img class="pic" src="mcc.jpeg" 
				alt="marie curie" title="Marie Curie" />
    	    <p>In 1898, the Curies announced the discovery of a new chemical element,
    	    polonium, then no more than a year later, radium. They were awarded the 
    	    <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1911/">Nobel 
    	    Prize for Physics</a></li> in 1903. Marie took over her husband's teaching post after 
    	    he died due to a carriage. After the dedicating herself to continuing the work they 
    	    started, Marie Curie received a second Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1911.</p>
    	    
    	    <p>Her research led her to helped to equip ambulances with x-ray 
    	    equipment, during WWI. Because of this, the <a href="https://www.icrc.org/en">
    	    International Red Cross</a></li> made her head of its radiological service and 
    	    she held training courses for medical orderlies and doctors in the new techniques. 
    	    Marie never was given significant financial benefits from her work because she 
    	    faced great opposition from male scientists in France. Her health began to go
    	     downhill by the late 1920s. She died on July 4, 1934 from leukemia. Her 
    	     leukemia was caused by the large amounts of exposure to high-energy 
    	     radiation from her research. Marie Curie seemed to have made a great impact
    	      on science research and lived a very successful life.</p>
